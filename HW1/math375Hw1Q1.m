% 

%% Initial value of z  
z = [10 40 50 80 30 70 60 90];

%% a) z (1:2:7) = zeros (1,4)
%answer : 

z(1:2:7) = zeros(1,4)

% It will asssign 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th value of z to 0. 


%% Re-Initializing the  value of z
z = [10 40 50 80 30 70 60 90];


%% b) z([3 4 8 1 ]) = []
%answer :

z([3 4 8 1]) = []

% It will remove 3rd, 4th, 8th and 1st value of z matrix.
